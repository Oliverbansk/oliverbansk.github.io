<!-- Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a final-year undergraduate at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Yizhou Wang](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/yizhouwang/index.htm).

I am fortunate to have been introduced to academic research by [Xiaoxuan Ma](https://shirleymaxx.github.io/) and [Wentao Zhu](https://wentao.live/about.html) at [Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/), and I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate closely with Prof. [Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/).

I am passionate about **3D Vision**, **Robotics**, and **Human-centered AI**, particularly interested in crafting efficient & generalizable solutions for fundamental 3D vision tasks in embodied applications (e.g. robot pose estimation) while applying advances from vision community to enhance robot perception, manipulation, and human-robot interaction.

I have gained experience and am actively expanding my knowledge in these fields through comprehensive surveys and hands-on experiments.
