<!-- Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

How to pronounce my name: Sh-kwhen Ban :) I also go by Oliver!

I am a first-year master student (MS in Robotics) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/). I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate years, I was previleged to be advised by Prof. [Yizhou Wang](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/yizhouwang/index.htm), and to have worked closely with Prof. [Yunzhu Li](https://yunzhuli.github.io/).

I am fortunate to have been introduced to academic research by [Xiaoxuan Ma](https://shirleymaxx.github.io/) and [Wentao Zhu](https://wentao.live/about.html) at [Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/).

<!-- I am passionate about 3D vision, robotics, and human-centered AI, with particular interests in developing efficient & generalizable solutions for fundamental embodied vision tasks (such as pose estimation), and applying advances in 3D vision to enhance robot perception, manipulation, and human-robot interaction. -->

My research interest lies mainly in **3D Vision**, **Embodied AI** and **Human-robot Interaction**.

<!-- 1. Developing efficient and generalizable solutions for fundamental 3D perception tasks. 
2. Facilitating robust large-scale learning for robot manipulation and human-robot interaction. -->
