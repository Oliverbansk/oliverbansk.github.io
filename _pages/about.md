<!-- Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a final-year undergraduate at Yuanpei College, Peking University, advised by Prof. Yizhou Wang at the Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies. I am fortunate to have been introduced to academic research by Dr. Xiaoxuan Ma and Dr. Wentao Zhu, and I am grateful for the opportunity to collaborate closely with Prof. Yunzhu Li at Columbia University.

<!-- I am passionate about 3D vision, robotics, and human-centered AI, with particular interests in developing efficient & generalizable solutions for fundamental embodied vision tasks (such as pose estimation), and applying advances in 3D vision to enhance robot perception, manipulation, and human-robot interaction. I aim to further expand my knowledge in these fields through surveys and hands-on experiments. -->
